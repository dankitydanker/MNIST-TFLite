# MNIST-TFLite

## TensorFlow 2.0 (alpha)

This respository contains Jupyter Notebook with the code running on TensorFlow 2.0 alpha. As this is not yet stable version, entire code may break in any moment. Notebook was created just for the Colaboratory environment. It requires some changes to make it working on Docker environment described in the blog post.
